1. Download DDLC and copy all of its' RPA files to the game folder of DDMD.
2. Download your favorite mod.
3. Make a folder in DDMD's game folder called 'mods'.
4. Open the 'mods' folder and make a folder for the mod you want to install.
(I suggest the name of the mod or it's acroymn)
5. Copy the 'game' folder of the mod that you want to play to the mod folder you just made.
(If there is no game folder and it's all just RPAs or RPYCs, make a 'game' folder in the
mod folder you made and copy the files into that folder.

7. Press F9 to open the Mod Docker menu and select your mod by clicking on it and pressing Select.
