1. Download DDLC and copy all of its' RPA files to the game folder of Mod Docker.
2. Download your favorite R6 mod.
3. Make a folder in Mod Docker's game folder called 'mods'.
4. Open the 'mods' folder and make a folder for the mod you want to install.
(I suggest the name of the mod or it's acroymn)
5. Copy the 'game' folder of the mod that you want to play to the mod folder you just made.
(If there is no game folder and all you have is just RPAs or RPYCs, make a 'game' folder 
in the mod folder you made and copy all the files into that folder).
6. Launch Mod Docker via DDMD-SE.exe.
7. Press F9 to open the Mod Docker menu and select your mod by clicking on it and pressing Select.
8. Restart the game and relaunch Mod Docker.
9. Done!

(To switch back to normal mode, select DDLC Mode.)
