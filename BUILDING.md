## Building Mod Docker With Fixes

1. Clone this repository or download the code and extract the folder to your Ren'Py projects folder.
2. Add DDLC's RPA files into Mod Docker's game folder.
3. Rename `main.py` in your Ren'Py SDKs _renpy_ folder to a different extension.
4. Copy `main.py` from Mod Docker's _renpy_ folder to your Ren'Py SDKs _renpy_ folder.
5. Launch your Ren'Py SDK, select DDModDocker and click Build Distributions.

If you haven't, make sure you are running a patched and fixed scripts.rpa file before building on R8.
